Show your Google rating on your website with a simple badge, including stars and number of reviews.

== Description ==
Simple Reviews Badge is a lightweight plugin that displays aggregate Google Reviews and star ratings in a customisable badge format. It uses the Google Places API to fetch and display reviews with schema markup support for better SEO. 

**Key Features:**
* Display Google Reviews with aggregate ratings and stars.
* Customisable through WordPress admin settings.
* Supports schema markup for enhanced SEO.
* AJAX-based loading for better performance.
* Filterable and customisable HTML structure.

## Usage

You can display the Simple Reviews Badge on any page or post by using the following shortcode:

`[simple_reviews_badge_display_reviews include_schema="true" img_src="./logo.png"]`
